In the context of Swarm, storage and bandwidth are the two most important limited
resources and this is reflected in our incentives scheme. The incentives for bandwidth
use are designed to achieve speedy and reliable data provision, while the storage
incentives are designed to ensure long term data preservation. In this way, we ensure
that all requirements of web application development are provided for – and that
incentives are aligned so that each individual node’s actions benefit not only itself, but
the whole of the network.

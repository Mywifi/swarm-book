# incentives scheme
In the context of Swarm, storage and bandwidth are the two most important limited
resources and this is reflected in our incentives scheme. The incentives for bandwidth
use are designed to achieve speedy and reliable data provision, while the storage
incentives are designed to ensure long term data preservation. In this way, we ensure
that all requirements of web application development are provided for – and that
incentives are aligned so that each individual node’s actions benefit not only itself, but
the whole of the network.

# data privacy
Despite this growing interest in the ebb and flow of data, the big tech corporations
maintain a firm grip on much of it, and the devil is in the details. Swarm’s privacy-first
model requires that no personal data be divulged to any third parties, everything
is end-to-end encrypted out of the box, ending the ability of service providers to
aggregate and leverage giant datasets. The outcome of this is that instead of being
concentrated at the service provider, control of the data remains decentralised and
with the individual to which it pertains. And as a result, so does the power. Expect
bad press
